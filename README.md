DotNetify is a free, open source project that lets you create modern web applications using HTML5 and C#. 

This project offers developers the architecture and tools to write single-page web applications on .NET platform (including Mono) that are sophisticated, richly interactive, bandwidth efficient, and support real-time push notification out-of-the-box.

Written in both Javascript and C# .NET, dotNetify builds on popular open-source libraries like 
[jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) and [SignalR](http://asp.net/signalr). It does not attempt to get away from the current open web standards, but rather complement and enhance them in such a way that brings the most benefit to you!

##Features

* Back-End MVVM Architecture (HTML5 View/C# View Model)
* Real-Time Web Out-of-the-Box
* Clean & Lean Code
* Leverage Full Power of .NET
* Deep Routing
* Support both ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET 4.5 and [Nancy](https://github.com/dsuryd/dotNetify-Nancy-demo).
