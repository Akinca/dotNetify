![alt build](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dsuryd/dotnetify?svg=true)

DotNetify is a free, open source project dedicated to .NET developers who believe that the .NET framework can still be relevant and competitive in the front-end web development of today. 

This project offers those developers the architecture and tools to write single-page web applications on .NET platform (including Mono) that are just as sophisticated, richly interactive, bandwidth efficient, support real-time push notification and yet, powered with .NET language features and patterns, are so much easier to develop and maintain.

Written in both Javascript and C# .NET, dotNetify builds on popular open-source libraries like 
[jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com) and [SignalR](http://asp.net/signalr). It does not attempt to get away from the current open web standards, but rather complement and enhance them in such a way that brings the most benefit to you!
